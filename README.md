nec-to-ps2
==========

A VHDL-based receiver for NEC-encoded IR remotes; and a piece of hardware to convert NEC values to PS/2. Intended to allow easy conversion from PS/2-based "remote control" projects to IR remote control; used in one of the university courses the author teaches.

-A work in progress, though NEC receipt is working, if unpolished.
